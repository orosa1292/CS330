# How do I approach designing software?
When it comes to how I approach designing software, I like to look at it as trying to figure out or solve a puzzle. When given a set of requirements or features, the process of implementing these requirements or features is about figuring out an effective way to reach a solution. 

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
With no prior experience using OpenGL before this course, much of what was in the final product was new information gathered over the course. I focused primarily on lighting and textures in this project, and trying to recreater a scene with something resembling a bit more of a realistic lighting by utilizing dark textures and shader material to help reflect or absorb the lights in this project.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?
Much of the process I used was simply testing, by making small adjustments and implementing them until I found something I liked, or fit the requirements. This would be done throughout the entire development process of this project, and has honestly been a great help in finishing this project in a timely manner.

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think whether one is working on something visual, like graphic design or rendering, or simply coding in general, testing and making small or minor adjustments is applicable. It is important to not do too much without making sure those small adjustments are functional otherwise, one could run into issues and not be entirely certain how they came to be or how to locate and fix them.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I typically like to implement a simple or efficient approach, and try to eliminate bugs or mistakes as I go along with small changes and tests. This I found to be very helpful and doesn't lead to much burnout or frustration and ensures that my code works as I go and that any issues that arise are handled accordingly an efficiently as possible.

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Lighting and textures played a major role in my strategy. I had originally intended to have directional lighting in my scene to help accentuate the objects used. But I decided to utilize spotlights and darker textures on my objects that acheived a look that I was not expecting but suited the scene exceptionally well that it became the final scene for the project.

# How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration helps to ensure the code is readable and easier to work with. Having the code broken down into smaller parts allows one to work with specific portions of the code more efficiently.

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My original milestones were a bit simpler and were focused more on a specific object, rather than a whole room as the scene. I felt this was a good decision, as it worked more towards my interesting in lighting and texturing, and resulted in implmenting a somewhat realistic room, with lighting adjusted for each object and the textures used on these objects working in tandem with the lights to create a realistic scene that I had envisioned for the project.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My long term goals, beyond my academic goals, is to work in software engineering and development. I've always been fascinated with technology, and a bit of a computer nerd, so I've always felt like this direction would suit me. I've never worked with visual related design, so this course has been a very new experience for me. I feel any new information is valuable information, and knowing more about the field and the various aspects can only open new doors and possibly new carrer paths to choose from, so this was a very welcomed experience none the less.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Graphic design is something I had only started tinkering with in this course, and utilizing software designed for this purpose. I had never worked with graphic design building a project from scratch. This new information will benefit future courses where this informatiion may apply and will only expand upon what I know which will only make me that much better for the future.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Similarly to my academic career, I believe this information could be valuable where visual and graphic design is applicable in the professional field, however it does still solidfy the importance of organization and maintaining industry best practices which is not only invaluable to any future professional pathway but I would also go as far as to say mandatory as well.
